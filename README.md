# Breaking Bad Next.js

I am testing and learning how to use Next.js.

I quickly through a quick page using a free Breaking Bad API: https://breakingbadapi.com/

## Purpose

The purpose of this app will be to explore the Next.js framework and test out various concepts and potential integrations.

## Demo

## Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

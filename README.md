# Breaking Bad Next.js

I quickly created A Breaking Bad app using the Next.js framework and a free Breaking Bad API.

## Purpose

The purpose of this app will be to explore the Next.js framework and test out various concepts and potential integrations.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
